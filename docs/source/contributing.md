# Contributing to Source

> How to contribute to the Source Design System for developers.

## Local development

Install dependencies using pnpm:

```shell
$ pnpm i
```

### Develop using Storybook

Run all CSNX storybooks in a single instance:

```shell
$ make storybooks
```

Build all storybooks:

```shell
$ make build-storybooks
```

## Guidelines

### Creating new components

- New components should be added to the [Development Kitchen](https://github.com/guardian/csnx/tree/main/libs/%40guardian/source-react-components-development-kitchen).
- New components must have a CODEOWNER.

### Using Emotion

- First familiarise yourself with Emotion's documentation â€“ we use [the React flavour](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction#react)
- Prefer composing styles using the `css` tag and the `css` prop.
- Avoid using `styled` to create or extend components.
  - Every styled component rendered creates an additional `Context.Consumer` component, which can lead to [performance issues](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2019/the-unseen-performance-costs-of-css-in-js-in-react-apps/).
- <em>Avoid dynamic styles</em>. Prefer using conditional logic in the component
  to compose numerous small chunks of CSS using the `css` prop.
- One example of unavoidable dynamic styles is Theming.

### Documentation

- Source uses [Storybook](https://guardian.github.io/csnx) for its API documentation as well as for visual regression testing.

### Testing

- Ensure you test your changes against our accessibility testing guide (see 'Raising a pull request' below).
- Ensure your component works against the following browsers (you can [ask for access to Browserstack Live](mailto:divx@theguardian.com?subject=Browserstack)):
  - **Chrome 77+**
  - **Firefox 68+**
  - **Edge 17+**
  - **Safari 12+**
- Ensure your component can be imported and server-rendered on a project running **Node.js v14**.
- Ensure your component works on touchscreen devices.

### Commits

- Before raising a pull request, squash your commits. Fewer commits makes the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/guardian/source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) (slightly) more readable.
- Each commit should contain changes to exactly one package. If you need to edit multiple packages as part of a change, please divide these into separate commits. Again, this is for CHANGELOG readability.
- Commit messages should read as if you are instructing someone else what to do. It usually helps to start with a verb. For example, "Increase the line height of the body text".

### Raising a pull request

- Generate a changeset describing your work by running `make changeset` and following the prompts.
- Test that your component can be used in a real project (e.g. [dotcom-rendering](https://github.com/guardian/dotcom-rendering)). In the project folder, use [`pnpm link`](https://pnpm.io/cli/link) to avoid having to perform a real publish, and [`pnpm pack`](https://pnpm.io/cli/pack) to see exactly which files would be published.

#### Testing checklist

##### Accessibility

- [ ] [Tested with screen reader](https://github.com/guardian/accessibility/blob/main/people-and-technology/03-visual.md#screen-reader)
- [ ] [Navigable with keyboard](https://github.com/guardian/accessibility/blob/main/people-and-technology/02-physical.md#keyboard)
- [ ] [Colour contrast passed](https://github.com/guardian/accessibility/blob/main/people-and-technology/03-visual.md#contrast)
- [ ] [The change doesn't use only colour to convey meaning](https://github.com/guardian/accessibility/blob/main/people-and-technology/03-visual.md#use-of-colour)

##### Cross browser and device testing

- [ ] Tested with touch screen device

##### Responsiveness

If there are guidelines around how much content the component can support, or how wide its container may get, please specify them in the documentation section.

- [ ] Tested at all breakpoints
- [ ] Tested with with long text
- [ ] Stretched to fill a wide container

#### Documentation

- [ ] Full API surface area is documented in the README
- [ ] Examples in Storybook

### Merging Source PRs

CSTI members have permissions to merge your PR. Ping the team on [divx@theguardian.com]((mailto:divx@theguardian.com?subject=Source PR)) if your PR needs prompt attention.

### Versioning

- `make changeset` will prompt you to choose a [semver](https://semver.org/) change type for your changes (major/minor/patch).
- This should include visual changes, not just changes to the API e.g.
  - A slight colour tweak could break contrast ratio guidlines, and comsumers would need to account for this, meaning it's not a drop-in change i.e. major/breaking.
  - A new font-size will only affect consumers who want to use it, making it a new feature i.e. a minor change.
  - Giving different text-sizes custom underline heights improves accessibility but doesn't require further changes, and all current consumers get the benefit i.e. a patch.

## Publishing

Publishing is triggered by merging the auto-generated _Release Package Updates_ PR that changesets manages.

### Force publishing unchanged packages

There are times when you want to publish a new version of a package even
when the package source code hasn't changed. In these cases, you should:

- create a new changeset
- create a PR explaining why the package needs to be bumped
