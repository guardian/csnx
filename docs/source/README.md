## Source packages ⚛️

There are three main Source packages:

- [`@guardian/source-foundations`](../../libs/@guardian/source-foundations/README.md): The atoms from which all our visual design is built. They may be used with any CSS-in-JS library
- [`@guardian/source-react-components`](../../libs/@guardian/source-react-components/README.md): A set of robust, accessible React components built using @guardian/source-foundations
- [`@guardian/source-react-components-development-kitchen`](../../libs/@guardian/source-react-components-development-kitchen/README.md): The Development Kitchen is where new components and patterns can be cooked up, tested and shared. There are minimal acceptance criteria. It’s okay to duplicate and break things. If a Kitchen component proves valuable, it may be promoted to `@guardian/source-react-components`
