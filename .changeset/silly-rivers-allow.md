'@guardian/tsconfig': major

Sets `moduleResolution` to `bundler` (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/#moduleresolution-bundler), bringing the compiler's behaviour into line with application bundlers.

This is also the first major release as the rest of the defaults have settled down.
