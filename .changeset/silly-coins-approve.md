Adds [web typography presets](https://guardian.github.io/storybooks/?path=/story/source-foundations_typography--presets) to unify typographic language in [designs](https://www.theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/01555f-typography-presets/b/830670) and code implementations.

From now on, these presets should be used instead of [the old typography API](https://guardian.github.io/storybooks/?path=/docs/source-foundations_typography-api-deprecated--docs), which this release deprecates.

_Please get in touch with the CSTI team if you need any guidance or assistance with migrating existing uses of the API to the new presets._

For the curious, here is how the new presets map to the old API:
