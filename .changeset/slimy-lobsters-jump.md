CMP: Implement the Multi-State-Privacy-Agreement in the US
In this release, we are now providing the **gpp so third party vendors that have migrated will switch to this. The **uspapi will stay for a transitionary period for vendors yet to migrate.

- Adding the window.\_\_gpp stub function in the US region
- Updating the US framework to use usnat instead of ccpa as a framework
- Migrated ccpa types/functions to aus.
