Applies consistent spacing around checkboxes and radio buttons by removing conditional styles and using padding to ensure minimum height of 44px.

The external padding is now consistent regardless of the presence of a label and / or supporting text, and removes any inconsistency when these elements are stacked vertically.

Checkboxes and radio buttons are also now aligned with the first line of text when labels wrap on to multiple lines.
