_tl;dr_

- linting for conformance with our `prettier` config is slow
- to speed up linting, we will stop doing that
- you should use `prettier` directly

### Before

We extended `plugin:prettier/recommended` which

1. used `eslint-config-prettier` to disable any white-space formatting rules that would conflict with our prettier config
2. used `eslint-plugin-prettier` to lint for formatting errors that did not match our prettier config

This is quite expensive, and although it means you could use `--fix` to apply prettier, it's not as fast as using prettier directly.

### After

We still use `eslint-config-prettier` to avoid conflicts with our `prettier` config, but we no longer lint for errors (and therefore also don't fix them).

### Recommendations

Use `prettier` directly, e.g.

- via [editor integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
- via a [pre-commit hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)

If you prefer the way this used to work, add the [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) manually to your ESLint config.
