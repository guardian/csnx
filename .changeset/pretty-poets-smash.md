Requires curly braces in all circumstances.

This should help reduce noise in diffs, and remove ambiguity about when you should use curly braces (and possibly when a block starts and ends), especially for people unfamiliar with the language.

_Note that this rule is fixable, so running eslint with the `--fix` flag will automatically update your code to comply with the new setting._
