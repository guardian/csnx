- Adds `collapseUntil` option to `Inline` layout component to allow collapsing into a single column below a given breakpoint.
- Text and icons are now horizontally centred within buttons. Visually this is only apparent if a button's styles have been overridden and it is stretched beyond it's natural intrinsic width. (Previously the text and icon would be pushed to the edges of the button.)
