  # It composes the individual project storybooks, which are built and deployed
  # by AWS Amplify projects on commits to main branch.
  #
  # To add another project storybook, you need to add a new AWS Amplify project.
  #
  # See the existing projects (prefixed with "csnx/storybooks-") at
  # https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=eu-west-1 for
  # examples of how to do this.
