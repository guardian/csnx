# This deploys the root-level storybook to GitHub Pages once CI has completed on main.
#
# It composes the individual project storybooks, which are built and deployed
# by AWS Amplify projects on commits to main branch.
#
# To add another project storybook, you need to add a new AWS Amplify project.
#
# See the existing projects (prefixed with "csnx/storybooks-") at
# https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=eu-west-1 for
# examples of how to do this.
