      # The Nx convention is to build projects to a root `dist` directory
      # (outside their source directories), but changesets uses pnpm's workspace
      # to look for the source directory of candidate packages when trying to
      # publish.
      #
      # Therefore, after building the packages we are going to publish, we will
      # rewrite the pnpm workspace file to point to the root `dist` directory
      # instead.
      #
      # This will allow changesets to find the newly built assets to publish.
      #
      # Inspired by this article:

      # This is a workaround for bug in changesets where it throws if you tell

      # stop it trying to create release PRs for them, which works fine. But at
      # this point in the lifecycle, we don't build any @csnx/* packages, so it
      # throws an error looking for them in `dist/libs` (see above) to ignore.
