### Bundling

This package uses `ES2020`.

If your target environment does not support that, make sure you transpile this package when bundling your application.

### Local Testing Using Linking

1. In the command line in your terminal, navigate to the csnx root directory. Run:

```sh
make @guardian/cmp:build
```

This build command has to be re-run for changes to be picked up.

2. Navigate to the repo that will test your code changes. In the appropriate folder of that repo, run

```sh
npm/yarn/pnpm link ../csnx/libs/@guardian/cmp
```

where '../csnx' is the path to your local changes in csnx where you cloned the csnx code to.

After re-building the '@guardian/cmp' in step 1. this command does not have to be repeated and changes will be automatically picked up.

3. Once youâ€™ve developed your changes and tested, you can unlink from the repo where you are testing the changes

```sh
npm/yarn/pnpm unlink ../csnx/libs/@guardian/cmp
```
