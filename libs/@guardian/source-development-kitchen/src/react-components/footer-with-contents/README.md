### API

The `<FooterLinks>` component can take a prop `links`, this prop is an array of `FooterLink` or `FooterButton` objects.

A `FooterLink` object can be used if you want to include an anchor tag with an href in the footer. A `FooterButton` object can be used to include a button with an `onClick` callback of your specification. The anchors and buttons will be styled to appear the same.

If your site uses the Guardian CMP `@guardian/consent-management-platform`, you should include a `FooterButton` object in the `links` prop with an `onClick` callback that launches the CMP and the text "Privacy Settings".
