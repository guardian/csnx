# Typography

Typographic choices affect how textual content is interpreted; influencing tone,
hierarchy and legibility.

## Example

```tsx
import {
	article17,
	headlineMedium42,
	textSans14,
} from '@guardian/source-foundations';

const h1 = css`
	${headlineMedium42};
`;

const p = css`
	${article17};
`;

const copyright = css`
	${textSans14};
`;
```

Typography presets are strings by default, but can also be used as [Emotion object styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/object-styles).

```tsx
import { headlineMedium42Object } from '@guardian/source-foundations';

const h1 = {
	...headlineMedium42Object,
};
```

## Where can I find the Guardian's fonts?

The canonical source of fonts is [https://github.com/guardian/fonts](https://github.com/guardian/fonts)

They should be loaded from the locations specified in [`font-faces.css`](https://github.com/guardian/fonts/blob/main/fonts/web/font-faces.css). This optimises for consistency and performance across The Guardian's digital products.

## API

The [typography presets](https://theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/01555f-typography-presets/b/830670)
are exported as variables that return a snippet of CSS. Each preset encapsulates
a specific combination of font family, size, line height, weight and style.

The names of the presets reference font sizes in pixels for ease of
understanding, but the API returns font sizes in rem and unitless line heights.

_Note:_ whilst rem font sizes and unitless line heights are recommended, a
method to convert these back to pixel values where required will be added in a
future update.

## Typography presets

The Guardian has four bespoke typefaces, which were created for different
purposes. When used effectively, they create contrast and alter the tone in
which text is read.

### Where do we use web typography presets?

Any content in a web browser or a webview in the app uses web typography
presets.

- _Browser_ — All [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com) content
  (front and article pages) and supporter revenue pages.
- _App webview_ — Article pages, sign-in and registration pages

#### Guardian Headline

Use for headlines, headings and any short form text like pull quotes, bylines
and titles.

#### Kicker — Guardian Headline

Use for a kicker in the fronts card.

#### Guardian Text Sans

Use for interactive page elements like buttons and text input fields and for
meta information like datelines, image captions and data visualisations.

_Note:_ Text Sans is used across the board on paid content templates to help
differentiate from editorial content.

#### Guardian Titlepiece

Use for impact. Ideal for marketing messages, page headers and numerals. Use
sparingly and at large sizes only.

_Note:_ this font is not available on [theguardian.com](https://theguardian.com)
