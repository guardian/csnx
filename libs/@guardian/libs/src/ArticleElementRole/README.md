# `ArticleElementRole`

ArticleElementRole is a semantic/layout-oriented property that's applied to elements in an article. It describes the "role" of that element in the piece and how it should be laid out within the page. Consider the example of an image: is the image filling a "supporting" role? is it just a thumbnail? is it "showcasing" something?

Whilst most commonly used for images, it can also apply to atoms and embeds.

## Usage

```js
import { ArticleElementRole } from '@guardian/libs';
```
