/*********************
 * The list of vendors in this file is used in the function 'getConsentfFor'
 * when additional checks on consent are used.
 *
 * For example when loading an in-page audio player: getConsentFor('acast', state )
 * When vendors are added to Sourcepoint, they only need to be added here if additional consent check are used via the 'getConsentFor' function.
 * When vendors on this list are removed from Sourcepoint, all occurrences of 'getConsentFor( 'vendor' , .) need to be removed from code and then be removed from this list.
 * When a vendor id is changed in Sourcepoint, it also needs to be changed here.
 *
 * When updates are made to this file, all users of the library need to be upgraded to pick up the changes.
 * Important: Keep in sync with list of vendors in README.md
