> [!WARNING]

## How does it compare?

| Current package                                         | New (perhaps)                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `@guardian/source-foundations`                          | `@guardian/source`                           |
| `@guardian/source-react-components`                     | `@guardian/source/react`                     |
| `@guardian/source-react-components-development-kitchen` | `@guardian/source/react/development-kitchen` |

The exports described above should exactly match the current packages (they're built from same source files).

> [!CAUTION]
> This package may change/disappear at any time.
