# `Button Hover Colours`

## Background

The Source design system previously assigned a unique hover colour to buttons. However, as button colours have become customisable, that approach is no longer scalable or consistent.

To address this, we’ve established clear guidelines for hover colour selection and automated the process in code. This eliminates confusion and ensures consistent behaviour across all custom-coloured buttons.

Designers no longer need to specify hover colours—simply provide the background colour to developers.

## Note for developers

The automatic behaviour only works if a hex code is supplied. For example, if your code is using CSS variables you will need to use the exported `calculateHoverColour` function to perform the calculation for you.

```tsx
import { calculateHoverColour } from '@guardian/source/foundations';
```
