# Source Design Tokens

`tokens.json` contains the design tokens for Source, which are used to auto-generate values that are exported from `@guardian/source/foundations`.

## Development

Edit `tokens.json` and run `make build` to update the code in `../foundations/__generated__`, then include those changes in your commit.
