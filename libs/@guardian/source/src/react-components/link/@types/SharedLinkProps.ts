	 * Some elements are not trackable, e.g. `div`, `span`.
	 * Refer to the Ophan documentation for more information.

	 * to track. Then `add data-link-name="link-name"` to the anchor for which
	 * clicks will be tracked.

	 * The page views table will then contain `link-name` when the
	 * link is clicked.
