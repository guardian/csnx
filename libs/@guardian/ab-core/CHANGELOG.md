## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- e9ac438: Members of the `OphanAPIConfig` are now **required**. Consumers must pass a
  record function, an error reporter and an object of server-side tests.

  With the previously optional members, failure to record tests to Ophan would
  fail silently. This has been the case in `dotcom-rendering` since Oct 2023.

  In order to update your code to work identically, you must now provide the
  following keys to the constructorâ€™s argument. They are listed here along with
  the fallbacks previously applied:
  - `serverSideTests` &rarr; `{}`
  - `errorReporter` &rarr; `() => undefined`
  - `ophanRecord` &rarr; `() => undefined`

  Note that `errorReporter` has also been narrowed and it now receives a single
  parameter, which is still `unknown` due to the fact than anything can be thrown.
