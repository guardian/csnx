# GitHub Pages

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) app that is deployed to https://guardian.github.io/csnx.

Any project that lives in CSNX can use it to publish docs/test pages/whatever is useful to the project.

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```sh
make github-pages:dev
```

### Adding a new page

It's probably best to read [the Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages) and go from there.

Whatever makes sense for your team/project is fine.

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed when changes are merged to `main`.

## Why Astro?

Astro allows us to use any of the [frameworks it supports](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=frameworks), which should give project pages as much flexibility as possible.
